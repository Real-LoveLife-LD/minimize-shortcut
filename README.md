# Minimize Shortcut

Hide or show Discord with any shortcut.

# Issues

-	Setting keybinds (Default: `CTRL+Y`)
-	Unregistering keybind
-	Minimizing when another window is in front of Discord instead of bringing in to front

# Roadmap

-	Finish `KeybindRecorder`
-	Get window visibility state to hide or show properly

# Contribute
